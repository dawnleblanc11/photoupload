  ### Photos add a special touch to blog posts and other websites.  This application is designed to allow the user to upload an photo to a blog post and have it stored to display with the blog post.  The intent is to refactor this image upload code with the beach blog project at the heroku development listed below.

  ## Usage and Features 
  * Upon running the application via node index.js, you will be given a sample photo and be asked to upload your file.
  * The file will be stored temporarily in an uploads file
  * The temporary file will be then uploaded to AWS.
  * For future viewing in the blog, it will be downloaded from AWS.
